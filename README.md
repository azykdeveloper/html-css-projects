# HTML & CSS Projects

A simple collection of small projects built with only HTML and CSS.

Each folder represents a mini web UI â€” created to practice layouts, styling, and responsive design. These are not full-feature apps, but focused exercises to improve frontend fundamentals.

## Projects
[`01-art-design`](https://azykdeveloper.github.io/html-css-projects/01-art-design) - A basic landing page with clean visuals and layout.

More projects coming soon...
